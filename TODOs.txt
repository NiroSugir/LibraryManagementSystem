Future

	switch from mvc to mv v & move model to backend
	validation on client side is prone to abuse
	client app should not connect directly to db server, but to a backend server that sits in front of a db with db inaccessible

	pre-commit & pre-merge hooks
		auto format
		check if it builds
		linting
		unit test
		integration test
		end-to-end test
		
	responsive design for extreme sizes (larger monitors, small cellphones)

	i18n translation & localization
		use built in functionality from qt

	flash messages after signing up that it they are registered but not yet approved for full access.
		router methods & controller constructor should have an optional flash message parameter
		
	write error messages to a log file

	remember password
		set a token when logging in on private pc and use that token that is stored in the db to login

	
Highlights
	enable login button by revalidating every keystroke
	nested session class inside router
	friend class logincontroller restricts use of router's login method 
	singleton router
	mvc pattern
